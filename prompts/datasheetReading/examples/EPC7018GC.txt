EPC7018G
Rad Hard eGaN® 100 V, 80 A,
6.0 mΩ Surface Mount
Description
EPC Space FSMD-G series of eGaN® power switching HEMTs have been specifically designed for critical applications in the high reliability or commercial satellite space environments. These devices have exceptionally high electron mobility and a low temperature coefficient resulting in very low RDS(on) values. The lateral structure of the die provides for very low gate charge (QG) and extremely fast switching times. These features enable faster power supply switching frequencies resulting in higher power densities, higher efficiencies and more compact packaging.

Notes
Note 1. NEVER exceed the absolute maximum VDS of the device otherwise permanent damage/destruction may result.
Note 2. NEVER exceed the absolute maximum VGS of the device otherwise permanent damage/destruction may result.
We recommend use at no greater than +5 V as the HEMT is fully conducting at this point.

Note 3. RθJA measured with LCC3 package mounted to double-sided PCB, 0.063” thickness with 1.0 square inches of copper area on the top (mounting side) and a flood etch (3 square inches) on the bottom side.

Note 4. Measured using four wire (Kelvin) sensing and pulse measurement techniques. Measurement pulse width is 80 μs and duty cycle is 1%, maximum.

Note 5. With pulse measurement width 100–380 μs.

Note 6. Guaranteed by design/device construction. Not tested.
