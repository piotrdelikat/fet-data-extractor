• The characteristics shown in the two graphs
- Normalized Transient Thermal Impedance Junction to Ambient (25 °C)
- Normalized Transient Thermal Impedance Junction to Case (25 °C)
are given for general guidelines only to enable the user to get a “ball park” indication of part capabilities. The data are extracted from single pulse transient thermal impedance characteristics which are developed from empirical measurements. The latter is valid for the part mounted on printed circuit board - FR4, size 1" x 1" x 0.062", double sided with 2 oz. copper, 100 % on both sides. The part capabilities can widely vary depending on actual application parameters and operating conditions.
