Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note
• The characteristics shown in the two graphs
- Normalized Transient Thermal Impedance Junction to Ambient (25 °C)
- Normalized Transient Thermal Impedance Junction to Case (25 °C)
are given for general guidelines only to enable the user to get a “ball park” indication of part capabilities. The data are extracted from single pulse transient thermal impedance characteristics which are developed from empirical measurements. The latter is valid for the part mounted on printed circuit board - FR4, size 1" x 1" x 0.062", double sided with 2 oz. copper, 100 % on both sides. The part capabilities can widely vary depending on actual application parameters and operating conditions
