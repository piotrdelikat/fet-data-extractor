Stresses exceeding those listed in the Maximum Ratings table may damage the device. If any of these limits are exceeded, device functionality should not be assumed, damage may occur and reliability may be affected.
1. The entire application environment impacts the thermal resistance values shown. They are not constants and are only valid for the particular conditions noted.
2. Actual continuous current will be limited by thermal & electromechanical application board design.
3. EAS of 225 mJ is based on started TJ = 25°C, IAS = 67 A, VDD = 64 V, VGS = 10 V, 100% avalanche tested
