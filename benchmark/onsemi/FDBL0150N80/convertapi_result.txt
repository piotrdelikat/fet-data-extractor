Please note: As part of the Fairchild Semiconductor integration, some of the Fairchild orderable part numbers will need to change in order to meet ON Semiconductor’s system requirements. Since the ON Semiconductor product management systems do not have the ability to manage part nomenclature that utilizes an underscore (_), the underscore (_) in the Fairchild part numbers will be changed to a dash (-). This document may contain device numbers with an underscore (_). Please check the ON Semiconductor website to verify the updated device numbers. The most current and up-to-date ordering information can be found at www.onsemi.com. Please email any questions regarding the system integration to Fairchild_questions@onsemi.com.

Notes:
1: Current is limited by bondwire configuration.
2: Starting TJ = 25°C, L = 0.4mH, IAS = 64A, VDD = 40V during inductor charging and VDD = 0V during time in avalanche.
3: RθJA is the sum of the junction-to-case and case-to-ambient thermal resistance, where the case thermal reference is defined as the solder mounting surface of the drain pins. RθJC is guaranteed by design, while RθJAis determined by the board design. The maximum rating presented here is based on mounting on a 1 in² pad of 2oz copper.
