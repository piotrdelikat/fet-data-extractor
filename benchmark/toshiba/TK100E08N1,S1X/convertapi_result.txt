Note:  Using continuously under heavy loads (e.g. the application of high temperature/current/voltage and the significant change in temperature, etc.) may cause this product to decrease in the reliability significantly even if the operating conditions (i.e. operating temperature/current/voltage, etc.) are within the absolute maximum ratings.
Please design the appropriate reliability upon reviewing the Toshiba Semiconductor Reliability Handbook ("Handling Precautions"/"Derating Concept and Methods") and individual reliability data (i.e. reliability test report and estimated failure rate, etc).
