representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of information included herein and shall have no liability for the consequences of use of such information.

Short data sheet — A short data sheet is an extract from a full data sheet with the same product type number(s) and title. A short data sheet is intended for quick reference only and should not be relied upon to contain detailed and full information. For detailed and full information see the relevant full data sheet, which is available on request via the local Nexperia sales
office. In case of any inconsistency or conflict with the short data sheet, the full data sheet shall prevail.

Product specification — The information and data provided in a Product data sheet shall define the specification of the product as agreed between Nexperia and its customer, unless Nexperia and
customer have explicitly agreed otherwise in writing. In no event however, shall an agreement be valid in which the Nexperia product is
deemed to offer functions and qualities beyond those described in the Product data sheet.

9.3  Disclaimers
Limited warranty and liability — Information in this document is believed to be accurate and reliable. However, Nexperia does not give any representations or warranties, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of such information and shall have no liability for the consequences of use of such information.

In no event shall Nexperia be liable for any indirect, incidental,
punitive, special or consequential damages (including - without limitation - lost profits, lost savings, business interruption, costs related to the removal or replacement of any products or rework charges) whether or not such damages are based on tort (including negligence), warranty, breach of contract or any other legal theory.

Notwithstanding any damages that customer might incur for any reason whatsoever, Nexperia’s aggregate and cumulative liability towards customer for the products described herein shall be limited in accordance with the Terms and conditions of commercial sale of Nexperia.
Right to make changes — Nexperia reserves the right to make changes to information published in this document, including without limitation specifications and product descriptions, at any time and without
notice. This document supersedes and replaces all information supplied prior to the publication hereof.

Suitability for use — Nexperia products are not designed,
authorized or warranted to be suitable for use in life support, life-critical or safety-critical systems or equipment, nor in applications where failure or malfunction of a Nexperia product can reasonably be expected
to result in personal injury, death or severe property or environmental damage. Nexperia accepts no liability for inclusion and/or use of Nexperia products in such equipment or applications and
therefore such inclusion and/or use is at the customer’s own risk.

Quick reference data — The Quick reference data is an extract of the product data given in the Limiting values and Characteristics sections of this document, and as such is not complete, exhaustive or legally binding.

Applications — Applications that are described herein for any of these products are for illustrative purposes only. Nexperia makes no representation or warranty that such applications will be suitable for the specified use without further testing or modification.

Customers are responsible for the design and operation of their applications and products using Nexperia products, and Nexperia
accepts no liability for any assistance with applications or customer product design. It is customer’s sole responsibility to determine whether the Nexperia product is suitable and fit for the customer’s applications and
products planned, as well as for the planned application and use of customer’s third party customer(s). Customers should provide appropriate design and operating safeguards to minimize the risks associated with their applications and products.

Nexperia does not accept any liability related to any default,
damage, costs or problem which is based on any weakness or default in the customer’s applications or products, or the application or use by customer’s third party customer(s). Customer is responsible for doing all necessary testing for the customer’s applications and products using Nexperia products in order to avoid a default of the applications and
the products or of the application or use by customer’s third party customer(s). Nexperia does not accept any liability in this respect.

Limiting values — Stress above one or more limiting values (as defined in the Absolute Maximum Ratings System of IEC 60134) will cause permanent damage to the device. Limiting values are stress ratings only and (proper) operation of the device at these or any other conditions above those given in the Recommended operating conditions section (if present) or the Characteristics sections of this document is not warranted. Constant or repeated exposure to limiting values will permanently and irreversibly affect the quality and reliability of the device.
