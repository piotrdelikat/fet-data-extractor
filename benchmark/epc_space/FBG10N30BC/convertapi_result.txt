Rad Hard eGaN® 100 V, 30 A, 16 mΩ Surface Mount (FSMD-B)
Description
EPC Space FSMD-B series of eGaN® power switching HEMTs have been specifically designed for critical applications in the high reliability or commercial satellite space environments. These devices have exceptionally high electron mobility and a low temperature coefficient resulting in very low RDS(on) values. The lateral structure of the die provides for very low gate charge (QG) and extremely fast switching times. These features enable faster power supply switching frequencies resulting in higher power densities, higher efficiencies and more compact packaging.

Notes
Note 1. NEVER exceed the absolute maximum VDS of the device otherwise permanent damage/destruction may result.
Note 2. NEVER exceed the absolute maximum VGS of the device otherwise permanent damage/destruction may result.
We recommend a VGS of 5V for optimum operation across life and radiation.

Note 3. RθJA measured with FSMD-B package mounted to double-sided PCB, 0.063” thickness with 1.0 square inches of copper area on the top (mounting side) and a flood etch (3 square inches) on the bottom side.

Note 4. Measured using four wire (Kelvin) sensing and pulse measurement techniques. Measurement pulse width is 80 μs and duty cycle is 1%, maximum.

Note 5. Guaranteed by design/device construction. Not tested.

Note 6. The gate charge parameters are measured using the circuit shown in Figure 14. QS and associated components BT1, P1 and C1 form a high speed current source that serves as the test load for the DUT. A constant gate current (Iconst) of 1.5-3 mA is provided to the Gate of the DUT during the time that the ground switch (GS) is OFF (toff).
The DUT is switched ON and OFF using ground-sensed switch GS. The gate current is adjusted to yield the
desired charge per unit time (Iconst · time per division) on the measuring oscilloscope. The GS pulse drive ON time (ton)is adjusted for the desired observability of the gate-source voltage (VGS) waveform. The maximum duty cycle of the ground switch (toff /ton) should be set to 1% maximum. Please note that all gate-related signals are referenced to the “Source Sense” pin on the package. At all times during the measurement, the maximum gate-source voltage is clamped to 5 VDC.
